"""M2b: stored claims become a changeset of hunks in a SHADOW tree.

Nothing here writes to the vault. The shadow is a parallel tree under the
dream's own state directory (`state/dream/shadow/<vault-relative path>`) that
holds what each target file WOULD look like; the vault only ever sees a hunk
that apply.py has re-checked itself (M3). Two properties are tested rather
than assumed, in test_dream_shadow_is_isolated: `VaultWriter` refuses to write
anywhere under the state directory, and no shadow file is ever picked up by
`vault.load_notes()`.

Ownership is read from the TARGET FILE, never from the changeset, and it must
be positively proven: `class: derived`, or the dream's own marker block. A
note whose frontmatter has no `class` field at all is FOREIGN - the one case
this kind of check habitually gets wrong, because "no statement of ownership"
reads so easily as "free". It is the opposite: on 2026-07-29 exactly that
inference converted four hand-curated hubs into generated pages and replaced
114 hand-written lines.

Routing (which claim ends up in which note) is deliberately deterministic and
provisional: no model is involved in M2b/M3, and M4 (reconcile) replaces it
with real grouping and supersession judgement. What is NOT provisional is the
shape of a hunk and the ownership metadata on it - apply.py's gates are built
against exactly this schema (DREAM-PLAN.md Abschnitt 7).
