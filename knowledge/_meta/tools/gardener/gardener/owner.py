"""Project ownership: which person a project branch primarily belongs to.

`10-global/shared-brain.md` requires since 2026-07-13 that every project marks
"im MOC/Frontmatter, wessen Projekt es primaer ist (Owner-Feld)". Nothing ever
wrote that field: on 2026-08-10 a search for `owner:` over all 380 notes found
zero hits. This module fills exactly the gap the rule already describes.

What the field is NOT: a permission check. Retrieval never filters on it, and no
caller may treat a missing or foreign owner as "not allowed to read". MemArena
(arXiv 2608.02613, 20.05.2026) measures that permission-aware access to agent
memory fails in both directions at today's state of the art - the oracle leaks,
everything else is too timid to answer. The field records who holds the context,
and is the precondition for ever building more than that.

The owner is inferred from who CREATED a branch's notes, read from the commit
that added each file. Where no single person reaches `OWNER_MIN_SHARE` of them,
the field is written EMPTY rather than guessed: an unclear owner has to look
unclear, otherwise the first reader turns a guess into a fact.
